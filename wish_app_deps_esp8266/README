What is this?

This directory has copies of the required files from
mist-c99/wish_app_deps, in order to facilitate compilation on esp8266
target. The copies exist because when compiling for esp8266, we should
not have any of files under wish_app_deps, because they can be found
under wish-c99/src, but on the other hand we must include
wish_app.h from mist-c99/wish_app/, because it significantly differs
from wish-c99/src/wish_app.h, which would be included if we were to use
wish app deps from wish-c99/src.
